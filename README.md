# Enhanced Music Recommendation System with SHAP Explanations and PySpark

**Project Name:** SHAP-Driven Insights for Scalable Music Recommendations in Big Data with PySpark

## Objective:
To build a powerful, data-driven music recommendation system utilizing big data technologies. This project integrates PySpark for scalable data processing, K-Means clustering for insightful user grouping, and advanced analytics to deliver highly tailored music recommendations.

## Overview:
This project addresses key challenges in personalizing music recommendations within the music industry. By analyzing extensive datasets with clustering and recommendation algorithms, it aims to boost user satisfaction and engagement by matching song recommendations with individual user preferences.

## The Need:
Today’s digital music platforms offer millions of songs, making it difficult for users to discover music that aligns with their tastes. Traditional recommendation approaches that rely on metrics like genre and popularity often miss the finer details of personal preferences. A sophisticated recommendation system that can handle vast amounts of data and pinpoint user tastes is essential. This project aims to meet that need by designing an advanced, data-centric solution.

## About the Project:
Our music recommendation system leverages PySpark for managing big data efficiently, with several core components:

- Data Processing: Large dataset handling and cleansing with PySpark.
- User Segmentation: K-Means clustering to segment users based on unique listening patterns.
- Recommendation Algorithm: A tailored recommendation engine utilizing user segments to suggest songs likely to match user preferences.
- Evaluation: System performance assessment through key metrics.
- Our goal is to elevate user experiences by offering personalized music recommendations powered by big data and machine learning insights.

#### Collaborative-Based Filtering
The Collaborative Filtering approach relies on user behavior patterns, focusing on the relationship between users and items (songs) to make recommendations. Here’s how it works:

- User Interaction: The system observes the listening patterns of users and identifies similar users based on shared preferences.
- Recommendation Process: Songs listened to by similar users are recommended to each other. For example, if User 1 and User 2 both enjoy a specific genre or artist, a song listened to by User 1 may be recommended to User 2 and vice versa.
- Goal: This method does not rely on the attributes of the songs themselves but instead uses the collective listening behaviors across users. It's particularly effective when there are diverse listening habits across the user base


#### Content-Based Filtering
The Content-Based Filtering approach utilizes the features of songs (e.g., artist, genre) to recommend music based on the content characteristics. Here’s the process:

![ContentBased](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c534bab-7dc0-4101-b51a-540d2cdec4e8)
- User Preferences: The system identifies the type of songs a user frequently listens to, examining features such as artist, genre, or tempo.
- Recommendation Process: Songs with similar attributes to those that the user has previously enjoyed are recommended. For example, if a user often listens to songs by Arijit Singh, other songs by the same artist are suggested.
- Goal: This approach works well for users with a specific preference for certain types of content, making it suitable for personalized recommendations based on song attributes.
